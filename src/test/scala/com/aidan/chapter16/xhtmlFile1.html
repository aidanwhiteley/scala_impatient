          <h1>Critical Error and other stuff</h1>

          <h2>A blast from the past</h2>
          	   <p><a href="./music/ROOF13_full.jpg"><img src="./images/ROOF13.jpg" alt="Roof top gig - photo 1" class="floatRight" border="0" /></a>
			This page has links to a couple of recordings from when I used to play the guitar a bit more often than
			I do these days. I've not got round to listening to all the old C45s to pick out all the best stuff. In the
			meantime, this page has links to a couple of old recordings and some posters.</p>

			<p>
			These pictures are from the Longbrook Street "roof top gig" which was a lot of fun.
			As I remember it, it was one of the later Critical Error gigs and took place on the roof of Steveâ€™s flat.
			Other notables from these photos are Jo playing cello (a later addition to Critical Error line ups) and 
			that the lead guitarist is smoking and somewhat slimmer than now (and these two probably aren't totally unrelated).

			<p>In a slight attempt to save some ISP bandwidth, the links to music files are password protected. The
			userid is "CriticalError" (case sensitive) and the password is my dog's name (which can be easily found elsewhere on this site - all lowercase).<br/>

			<p>This song (<a href="./music/The_Mad_Song.mp3" target="_blank">mp3 format</a> or <a href="./music/The_Mad_Song.m4a" target="blank">iTunes m4a format</a>)
			is from a later tape where all sorts of bits and pieces were recorded on a ghetto blaster.
			Rose's voice is really great on this (I'm fairly sure this is just a recording of a practice at someone's house)
			and I love the DADGAD guitar tuning.
			While the acoustic guitar "booms" away at the low notes, I'm still pretty pleased with the "middle eight"
			guitar piece in this - I still think it is one of the better bits I've written on guitar.
			</p>
			
			<p>This song (<a href="./music/GoldenWings.mp3" target="_blank">mp3 format</a>)
			was recorded direct from the mixing desk at a gig at The Sleeper in Seaton. I'm guessing it is from
			about 1988 when Critical Error were gigging fairly frequently.
			The reason for picking this one out was that my band mates were <span class="strikeout">daft</span> generous
			enough to let me play lead, acoustic guitar <em>all</em> over the song. Well you don't turn down
			opportunities like that so I did with an enthusiasm completely unmatched
			by my level of musical skill. Still - great fun!
			</p>
			
			<p>This song (<a href="./music/Gypsy.mp3" target="_blank">mp3 format</a> or <a href="./music/Gypsy.m4a">iTunes m4a format</a>)
			is from an early demo with Critical Error. What I like about this
			song is that it reminds me how much I used to enjoy playing guitar with Steve Mavin.
			The other memory from recording this is that we were using a friend's (Baz Bishop) Boss Dimension C guitar
			pedal. All the synth sounding background "swells" as the song progresses are just guitars, basses and vocals
			going via the aformentioned Dimension C pedal.</p>
			
			<p>Here are a couple of links (<a href="./music/CriticalError1.jpg">pre-glastonbury</a>
			/ <a href="./music/CriticalError2.jpg">reptiles</a>) to the full size images for posters on this page.
			They've got Fanny's great drawings and lettraset from the Uni print shop (well computers still filled rooms in those days 
			or ran something called MS-DOS).<br/>
			The &quot;David McCallum Trio&quot; (one of the bands in the posters) was a duo - if you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L4H5JlPf1M" class="external">
			got that</a> you are showing your age!</p>

            <h2 id="oldphotos">Old photos</h2>
            <p>
            Shamelessly stolen from Paul Bateman's Facebook site, here are some photos from when Critical Error decided they needed 
            some publicity photos. Apparently we were so poor we could only afford black and white photos...
